# Weather FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Weather Questions

### What causes weather?
Weather is caused by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the Sun. This creates differences in air temperature and pressure, which drive wind patterns and precipitation. The Earth's rotation (Coriolis effect) also influences how air masses move.

### What is the difference between weather and climate?
**Weather** refers to short-term atmospheric conditions (hours to days) in a specific location - temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind, etc.

**Climate** is the average weather pattern over a long period (typically 30+ years) for a region. Climate tells you what to expect generally; weather tells you what's happening now.

### Why is weather prediction difficult?
Weather prediction is challenging because:
1. The atmosphere is a chaotic system - small changes can have large effects
2. We can't measure conditions everywhere simultaneously
3. Many interacting variables affect weather patterns
4. Prediction accuracy decreases rapidly beyond 7-10 days

## Cloud Questions

### What are the main cloud types?
1. **Cumulus** - Puffy, white clouds with flat bases. Fair weather clouds.
2. **Stratus** - Gray, sheet-like clouds covering the sky. Can bring drizzle.
3. **Cirrus** - Thin, wispy clouds high in the atmosphere. Made of ice crystals.
4. **Cumulonimbus** - Tall, dark thunderstorm clouds. Can produce heavy rain, lightning, and hail.

### What do different cloud colors mean?
- **White clouds** - Reflect sunlight, usually indicate fair weather
- **Gray clouds** - Thick clouds blocking sunlight, may bring rain
- **Dark/black clouds** - Very dense, often thunderstorm clouds
- **Red/orange clouds** - Sunrise/sunset colors, not weather indicators

## Precipitation Questions

### What causes rain?
Rain forms when:
1. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and land
2. Warm, moist air rises and cools
3. Water vapor condenses around tiny particles (cloud condensation nuclei)
4. Droplets grow by collision and coalescence
5. When heavy enough, droplets fall as rain

### What's the difference between rain, sleet, and freezing rain?
- **Rain** - Falls as liquid, reaches ground as liquid
- **Sleet** - Falls through a cold layer, freezes into ice pellets before hitting ground
- **Freezing rain** - Falls as liquid but freezes on contact with cold surfaces
- **Snow** - Forms and falls as ice crystals when temperatures are below freezing throughout

### How is rainfall measured?
Rainfall is measured in millimeters (mm) or inches using a rain gauge. The gauge collects rain over a period (usually 24 hours) and the depth is measured. For example:
- Light rain: less than 2.5 mm/hour
- Moderate rain: 2.5-7.5 mm/hour
- Heavy rain: more than 7.5 mm/hour

## Temperature Questions

### What factors affect temperature?
1. **Latitude** - Closer to equator = warmer
2. **Altitude** - Higher elevation = cooler (about 6.5°C per 1000m)
3. **Ocean proximity** - Coastal areas have more moderate temperatures
4. **Cloud cover** - Clouds trap heat at night, block sun during day
5. **Season** - Earth's tilt causes seasonal temperature variations

### What is wind chill?
Wind chill is the perceived temperature when wind is factored in. Wind removes heat from your body faster, making it feel colder than the actual air temperature. For example:
- Air temperature: -5°C
- Wind: 30 km/h
- Wind chill: approximately -13°C

### What is heat index?
Heat index (or "feels like" temperature) combines air temperature and humidity. High humidity makes it harder for sweat to evaporate, making it feel hotter. For example:
- Air temperature: 32°C
- Humidity: 70%
- Heat index: approximately 41°C

## Severe Weather Questions

### What causes thunderstorms?
Thunderstorms require three ingredients:
1. **Moisture** - Water vapor in the lower atmosphere
2. **Lift** - Something to push air upward (fronts, mountains, heating)
3. **Instability** - Warm air below, cold air above

When these combine, powerful updrafts form cumulonimbus clouds that produce lightning, thunder, heavy rain, and sometimes hail or tornadoes.

### What is a weather front?
A front is the boundary between two air masses of different temperatures:
- **Cold front** - Cold air pushing under warm air. Often brings brief, intense storms.
- **Warm front** - Warm air rising over cold air. Usually brings gradual, steady rain.
- **Stationary front** - Neither air mass advancing. Can cause prolonged precipitation.
- **Occluded front** - Cold front catches up to warm front. Complex weather patterns.

### What's the difference between a watch and a warning?
- **Watch** - Conditions are favorable for severe weather. Be prepared.
- **Warning** - Severe weather is imminent or occurring. Take action immediately.
