# Weather Forecast Guide

## Understanding Weather Forecasts

### How Weather Forecasts Are Made

Modern weather forecasting combines:
1. **Observations** - Data from weather stations, satellites, radar, weather balloons
2. **Computer models** - Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models simulate the atmosphere
3. **Human expertise** - Meteorologists interpret model output and add local knowledge

### Forecast Accuracy by Time Period

| Timeframe | Accuracy | Best For |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| 0-3 hours | 90%+ | Immediate planning |
| 1-3 days | 80-90% | Short-term planning |
| 4-7 days | 50-70% | General planning |
| 8-14 days | 40-50% | Trends only |
| Beyond 14 days | Low | Seasonal averages |

## Reading Forecast Maps

### Pressure Systems

**High Pressure (H)**
- Clockwise wind rotation (Northern Hemisphere)
- Associated with clear skies, calm weather
- Air sinks and warms, preventing cloud formation

**Low Pressure (L)**
- Counter-clockwise wind rotation (Northern Hemisphere)
- Associated with clouds, precipitation, wind
- Air rises and cools, forming clouds

### Isobars
Isobars are lines connecting points of equal atmospheric pressure:
- Closely spaced isobars = strong winds
- Widely spaced isobars = light winds
- Pressure is measured in hectopascals (hPa) or millibars (mb)
- Standard sea level pressure: 1013.25 hPa

### Front Symbols

| Symbol | Front Type | Weather |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Blue triangles | Cold front | Brief, intense precipitation |
| Red semicircles | Warm front | Gradual, steady precipitation |
| Alternating | Stationary front | Prolonged weather |
| Purple | Occluded front | Complex weather |

## Weather Terminology

### Precipitation Terms

- **Isolated** - Less than 20% coverage
- **Scattered** - 20-50% coverage
- **Numerous** - 50-70% coverage
- **Widespread** - More than 70% coverage

### Probability of Precipitation (PoP)

PoP indicates the likelihood of measurable precipitation (>0.01 inch) at any point in the forecast area.

- 20% PoP = Slight chance
- 40% PoP = Chance
- 60% PoP = Likely
- 80%+ PoP = Very likely

### Wind Terms

- **Calm** - Less than 1 km/h
- **Light** - 1-19 km/h
- **Moderate** - 20-39 km/h
- **Fresh/Strong** - 40-61 km/h
- **Gale** - 62-87 km/h
- **Storm** - 88-117 km/h
- **Hurricane/Typhoon** - 118+ km/h

## Weather Data Sources

### Satellites

**Geostationary satellites** (e.g., GOES, Meteosat)
- Stay fixed over one point on Earth
- Provide continuous monitoring
- 36,000 km altitude

**Polar-orbiting satellites** (e.g., NOAA, MetOp)
- Circle Earth pole-to-pole
- Provide detailed global coverage
- 850 km altitude

### Weather Radar

Radar sends out pulses of energy that bounce off precipitation:
- **Reflectivity** - Shows precipitation intensity (colors: green=light, yellow=moderate, red=heavy)
- **Doppler** - Measures wind speed and direction
- **Dual-polarization** - Distinguishes rain, snow, hail

### Weather Stations

Surface weather stations measure:
- Temperature and humidity
- Wind speed and direction
- Atmospheric pressure
- Precipitation
- Visibility
- Cloud cover

### Radiosondes (Weather Balloons)

Released twice daily worldwide to measure:
- Temperature through the atmosphere
- Humidity profile
- Wind speed and direction at altitude
- Critical for initializing weather models

## Specialized Forecasts

### Aviation Weather (METAR/TAF)

**METAR** - Current conditions at airports
```
METAR EGLL 121350Z 27010KT 9999 FEW040 18/09 Q1015
```
- EGLL: Airport code (London Heathrow)
- 121350Z: Day 12, time 13:50 UTC
- 27010KT: Wind from 270° at 10 knots
- 9999: Visibility 10km+
- FEW040: Few clouds at 4000 feet
- 18/09: Temperature 18°C, dewpoint 9°C
- Q1015: Pressure 1015 hPa

**TAF** - Forecast for next 24-30 hours at airports

### Marine Forecasts

Include:
- Wind speed and direction
- Wave height and period
- Visibility
- Sea state descriptions

### Agricultural Weather

Focus on:
- Growing degree days
- Soil moisture
- Frost/freeze warnings
- Drought indices
- Evapotranspiration rates

## Best Practices for Using Forecasts

1. **Check multiple sources** - Compare forecasts from different providers
2. **Understand uncertainty** - Longer range = more uncertainty
3. **Know your location** - Local terrain affects weather
4. **Update regularly** - Forecasts improve as event approaches
5. **Learn the patterns** - Understanding typical weather helps interpret forecasts
